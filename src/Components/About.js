                   Agora is an initiative to democratize these creative institutions that have enjoyed historical inaccessibility. 
                  Agora was formalized out of a shared alignment of beliefs to nurture creativity, history, and community. 
                 Our monthly collections respond to the shifting nature of society, curated in accordance with information from our Research & Development segment.
